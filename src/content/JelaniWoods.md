Another guy I was bullish on as a rookie and showed big flashes last year. His best showing coming from a week 12 contest with the Steelers where he had eight catches on ninetargets to go along with 98 scoreless yards. An athletic freak with a perfect 10 Relative Athletic Score. He'd be a full blown breakout candidate if he wasn't on IR and about to miss the first four games. A big play weapon should be a rookie quarterbacks best friend.
