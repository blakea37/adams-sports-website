•Rondale Moore WR (ARI) - I’ve been a fan of Moore since his rookie season in 2021, but he’s never quite put it together between injuries and inconsistent play. With the Cardinals likely to be playing from behind for much of this year his target count could be high. I’ll make the case for his athleticism from his electric freshman season at Purdue to show itself once again. 

•Jelani Woods TE (IND) - Another guy I was bullish on as a rookie and showed big flashes last year. His best showing coming from a week 12 contest with the Steelers where he had eight catches on nine targets to go along with 98 scoreless yards.  An athletic freak with a perfect 10 Relative Athletic Score. He’d be a full blown breakout candidate if he wasn’t on IR and about to miss the first four games. A big play weapon should be a rookie quarterbacks best friend.

•Desmond Ridder QB (ATL) - Ridder got his feet wet in the NFL towards the end of last season. While not overly impressive he was immensely better than Marcus Mariota. Drake London began to look like the rookie stud he was drafted to be. Now to begin the 2023 season Ridder will have a healthy Kyle Pitts to go along with sophomore London and rookie phenom Bijan Robinson. The closer you look it’s easy to see Ridder as a breakout candidate in Superflex leagues and a nice sleeper in 1QB leagues. 

•Justyn Ross/ Rashee Rice WR (KC) - One of these two is going to surprise this season. My money is on Rice, but both have the upside and profiles to do it. Reports out of Chiefs camp have both starting out as “package players” according to GM Brett Veach. Rice, a 2023 second round pick, gained steam with the 5th most receiving yards in the NFL this preseason, but struggled with drops in the final exhibition game. Ross is physically menacing and has been enjoying rave reviews throughout the off-season. Once a polarizing prospect, Ross went undrafted in 2022 because of serious injury concerns. Now injury free and paired with Patrick Mahomes the upside is high.

•Rashod Bateman WR (BAL) - He has shown flashes of being the WR1 in Baltimore, but injuries have plagued him along with the Ravens run first scheme. Enter Todd Monken who is expected to open up the passing game for the wide receivers in Baltimore. Rookie first rounder Zay Flowers and OBJ joining the receiving corps could stand in his way, but Bateman still has the upside to claim a large target share if he can stay healthy. Of course, Andrews is still going to command a large target share himself, but the need is there for a large bodied perimeter receiver. Especially if OBJ doesn’t regain form from his prime years or the injury bug strikes again. 

•Alexander Mattison RB (MIN) - Even in a passing league I’ve got to give a shout out to a RB I love. Probably more deserving to be on a breakout list than sleeper column, but I don’t want anyone to leave Mattison on the board when they have the chance. The pundits will say he’s never been in an every down role so nobody knows if he can truly put up the consistent numbers game to game. However, when given the chance to start for an injured Dalvin Cook, Mattison has delivered great results.
