I've been a fan of Moore since his rookie season in 2021, but he's never quite put it together between injuries and inconsistent play. With the Cardinals likely to be playing from behind for much of this year his target count could be high. I'll make the case for his athleticism from his electric freshman season at Purdue to show itself once again.
